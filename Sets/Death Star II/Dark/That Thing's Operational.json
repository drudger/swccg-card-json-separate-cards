While Death Star II orbits a system you occupy (except Endor), once during each of your control phases, opponent loses X Force, where X = 2 plus number of related battleground sites you occupy. Once during each of opponent's control phases, opponent's piloted starfighter here may attempt to 'blow away' Death Star II. Draw destiny. Add 3 if armed with torpedoes or missiles. Add pilot's ability.
